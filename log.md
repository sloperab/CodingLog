# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 23 January 2023, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub repo and review Git. Started creating columns and organizing data for future visualization.

**Thoughts** Pandas is giving me some trouble, editing and working with the columns hasn't been that easy. Compared to SQL aggregate functions it is a bit harder to manage.

### Day 8: 2 February 2023, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created first working streamlit app with chart and condensed graphing tools into a single function now running as a .py file instead of notebook.

**Thoughts** The app is looking nicely and can finally show my GF the analysis of our conversation. Still lots of work to be done but a first milestone is completed.
Realizing that with college studies finding one free hour to code every single day is hard. Will try to complete as many days consecutive days as I can however it is not realistic to always do it. Yet, the challenge ends after completing the 100 days.
