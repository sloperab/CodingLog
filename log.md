**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: 23 January 2023, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Set up GitHub repo and review Git. Started creating columns and organizing data for future visualization.

**Thoughts** Pandas is giving me some trouble, editing and working with the columns hasn't been that easy. Compared to SQL aggregate functions it is a bit harder to manage.

### Day 7: 31 January 2023, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Advanced greatly in visualization of the last aspects. Done with Emoji and streak.

**Thoughts** Weekend are hard days to work, I'm willing to keep the challenge going even if work is not done on weekends since internet is limited as well as time. Still progress has been considerable and feeling motivated to keep going and finish this first project. (According to the rules I owe 3 days.)

### Day 8: 2 February 2023, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created first working streamlit app with chart and condensed graphing tools into a single function now running as a .py file instead of notebook.

**Thoughts** The app is looking nicely and can finally show my GF the analysis of our conversation. Still lots of work to be done but a first milestone is completed.
Realizing that with college studies finding one free hour to code every single day is hard. Will try to complete as many days consecutive days as I can however it is not realistic to always do it. Yet, the challenge ends after completing the 100 days.
